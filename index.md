## About

---
I am a Master of Science student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I received my BS in Computational Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2019.

My research interests include computer vision, localization and mapping, and 3D perception with a specific interest in autonomous driving applications. For more information, see my [CV](/pdf/Resume_Anjali_Dhabaria.pdf)
