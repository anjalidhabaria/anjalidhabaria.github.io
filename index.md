## About

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I am a Master of Science student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology graduating in December, 2020. My research interests include computer vision, localization and mapping, and 3D perception with a specific interest in autonomous driving applications. <br><br>
I am currently working with Robotics Perception and Learning Lab, developing a framework that accounts for uncertainites while developing costmaps for sematic segmentation. In the past, I took special problem to develop extended kalman filter based Visual SLAM system.<br><br>
In terms of experience, I have recently completed Mapping and Localization Software Engineer Co-op at Torc Robotics  where I contributed to development and deployment of 3D maps. Before starting my masters at Georgia Institute of Technology, I was working at Optum, a United Health Group subsidary as a Associate Software Engineer where I was reponsible for developing and enhancing APIs to allow provider, facilities and payers to manage the claim lifecycle. <br><br> </div>

## Experience
---

### Mapping and Localization Software Engineer Co-op, Torc Robotics
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Worked on 3D reconstruction and mapping using point clouds from LiDAR. Researched through effective representation of massive 3D point clouds, geospatial data and LiDAR data for developing 3D LiDAR base maps for autonomous trucks. Integrated the 3D maps with the planning and mapping software stack.<br><br> </div>
