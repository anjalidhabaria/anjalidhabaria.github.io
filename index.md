<div style="text-align: right"> 

I am a Master of Science student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology graduating in December, 2020. My research interests include computer vision, localization and mapping, and 3D perception with a specific interest in autonomous driving applications. 

I am currently working with Robotics Perception and Learning Lab, developing a framework that accounts for uncertainites while developing costmaps for sematic segmentation. In the past, I took special problem to develop extended kalman filter based Visual SLAM system.

In terms of experience, I have recently completed Mapping and Localization Software Engineer Co-op at Torc Robotics  where I contributed to development and deployment of 3D maps. Before starting my masters at Georgia Institute of Technology, I was working at Optum, a United Health Group subsidary as a Associate Software Engineer where I was reponsible for developing and enhancing APIs to allow provider, facilities and payers to managae the claim lifecycle.

During my internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay), I got exposure to work on production scale internet of things (IoT) based products, developed a generic IoT platform for controlling electrical appliances remotely.
